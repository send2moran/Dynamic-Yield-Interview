The task :
In general this is a simple chat client using javascript and inter-iframe communication Using Angular.
 
1. There is no server code on this project, just client. Basically you can put everything in a directory that will include the "site"+assets you'll build and open it locally on the browser.
2. When a user opens the "site" all there is - is a "+" button. Every click on the "+" button adds an iframe to the page. This iframe is a chat client with the other iframes. Every iframe has a line you can write text in and press "send" to post. this post in shown on all iframes - like a chat room.
3. All the iframes should communicate with the parent frame using postMessage. iframes should not communicate directly between them.
 
Extra features:
1. Make it look nice
2. iFrame windows should be draggable on the screen.
3. support ascii conversions - :-) will become a happy face.
 

Please feel free to add more feature make it beautiful and so on. code should be well written, documented and designed.
